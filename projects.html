            <h1>Weather Owl</h1>
            <img src="./images/WeatherOwl.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="descOne">
            <p>This project was done in the Mobile Devices Course in UOIT. The concept of the project involves
                creating a useful mobile application that uses topics taught throughtout the course. Concepts involved
                AsyncTasks, Databases with SQLite, Internet and GPS, basic event setups, and Front-end setup with the
                scene builder provided by Android Studio</p>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, we used a variety of the concepts taught in class such as the SQLite Databases, GPS,
                and also
                made use of json parsing with the OpenWeatherMap API. The API has some limitations such as showing the
                weather for
                a few cities as it is the free version</p>

            <h1>OpenGL GameCube</h1>

        </div>
        <div class="descTwo">
            <p>This project was done in the Computer Graphics and Visualization Course in UOIT. The Idea of the Project
                was to
                create a GameCube logo with OpenGL using squares made from triangular mesh geometry.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The GameCube also was able to change
                from a defualt purple color to a lighted version, and also a textured version when clicking a button.
                The changes are done through the shader
                High-level Shader language (HLSL), and OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) files. Finally there are also some
                ways to move and
                rotate the cube using translations.
